# Steven Xu – Analytics & Systems Portfolio

Hi! I'm Steven (Yijue) Xu, a Biometry & Statistics student at Cornell University focusing on  
**data quality**, **Python/SQL analytics**, and **automated data pipelines**.

This portfolio highlights several analytics & systems projects aligned with roles in  
**Systems Analysis, Data Analytics, Network Data Quality, and Operations Reporting**.

# 📌 Featured Projects

## 1. **Climate & Crop-Model Data Pipeline (CMIP6)**
**Tools:** Python (pandas, xarray), data validation, reproducible pipelines  
**Skills Demonstrated:** automated ingestion, system integration, data cleaning, anomaly detection, large-scale data management

**Overview:**  
I built a reproducible Python pipeline to ingest and align large CMIP6 climate datasets with agronomic model inputs.  
The pipeline validates missingness, unit inconsistencies, and alignment errors—similar to improving network inventory data quality.

**What I did:**  
- Ingested multi-source climate datasets via automated scripts  
- Standardized schema and resolved alignment inconsistencies  
- Added validation checks for anomalies and missing fields  
- Generated system-friendly tables & visual summaries for research usage  

**Why it’s relevant:**  
This project shows the ability to work with **complex system data**, improve data quality, and manage **large, multi-source integrations**.

## 2. **Boxing Records Data Normalization & Predictive Insights**
**Tools:** Python (BeautifulSoup, pandas), SQL-style joins, data cleaning, visualization  
**Skills Demonstrated:** ETL pipeline design, working with messy semi-structured data, building analytical datasets

**Overview:**  
Scraped and cleaned 3,000+ professional boxing matches from irregular HTML pages and normalized them into a structured analytical dataset.

**What I did:**  
- Built scraping scripts to extract match metadata from inconsistent HTML  
- Normalized data fields (names, records, outcomes, rounds)  
- Created a clean relational dataset for analysis  
- Used linear-algebra-based features to explore fighter-level patterns  

**Why it’s relevant:**  
This mirrors Lightpath’s work with **inconsistent network data**, requiring transformation into inventory-ready tables.

## 3. **U.S. Obesity Drivers – Multi-Dataset Integration**
**Tools:** Python, EDA through R studio, classification & regression  
**Skills Demonstrated:** working with disparate public datasets, ad-hoc analysis, data quality handling

**Overview:**  
Built a unified analytical dataset by combining multiple heterogeneous public sources (income, access, demographics, health indicators).

**What I did:**  
- Resolved inconsistent schema across sources  
- Cleaned missingness / outliers  
- Performed regression & classification to identify key drivers  
- Created clean, ready-for-reporting analytical tables  

**Why it’s relevant:**  
This project shows experience with **data integration + exploratory systems analysis**, just like Lightpath’s network reporting & data audits.

## 4. **Startup Intelligence Scraper – Structured Evaluation Dataset**
**Tools:** Python, BeautifulSoup, Excel dashboard, data modeling  
**Skills Demonstrated:** data engineering basics, pipeline automation, data normalization

**Overview:**  
Built a custom scraper to extract >100 early-stage companies from Crunchbase/LinkedIn and convert them into a standardized evaluation table.

**What I did:**  
- Automated extraction of unstructured web data  
- Normalized categorical fields (industry, funding stage, traction)  
- Integrated multiple data sources into one consistent model  
- Created a dashboard-friendly dataset used for investment screening  

**Why it’s relevant:**  
Shows experience building **clean, accurate system-of-record datasets** from messy sources—exactly what systems analysts do.
